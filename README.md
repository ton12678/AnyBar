# AnyBar: OS X menubar status indicator

AnyBar is a small indicator for your menubar that does one simple thing: it displays a colored dot. What the dot means and when to change it is up to you.

## Download

Version 0.1.3:

<a href="https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar/releases/download/0.1.3/AnyBar-0.1.3.zip"><img src="AnyBar/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon_128x128@2x.png?raw=true" style="width: 128px;" width=128/></a>

Or using [Homebrew-cask](http://caskroom.io):

    brew cask install anybar

## Usage

AnyBar is controlled via a UDP port (1738 by default). Before any commands can be sent, AnyBar.app must be launched:

```sh
open /Users/yourusername/Applications/AnyBar.app
```

Once launched, you may send it a message to change the style of the dot:

```sh
echo -n "black" | nc -4u -w0 localhost 1738
```

The following default commands change the style of the dot:

<img src="AnyBar/Resources/white@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `white`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/red@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `red`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/orange@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `orange`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/yellow@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `yellow`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/green@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `green`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/cyan@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `cyan`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/blue@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `blue`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/purple@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `purple`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/black@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `black`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/question@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `question`  
<img src="AnyBar/Resources/exclamation@2x.png?raw=true" width=19 /> `exclamation`  

And one special command forces AnyBar to quit: `quit`

## Running multiple instances

You can run several instances of AnyBar as long as they listen on different ports. Use the `ANYBAR_PORT` environment variable to change the port and `open -n` to run several instances:

```sh
ANYBAR_PORT=1738 open -na AnyBar
ANYBAR_PORT=1739 open -na AnyBar
ANYBAR_PORT=1740 open -na AnyBar
```

## Custom images

AnyBar can detect and use local custom images stored in the `~/.AnyBar` directory. For example, if you have a `~/.AnyBar/square@2x.png` image, send `square` to port 1738 and it will be displayed. Images should be 19×19 pixels for standard resolution, and 38x38 pixels for retina (@2x).
